# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

As credit risk have become a inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the loans systems are easily outnumbered by risky loans. We oversampled the dataset, provided by LendingClub, using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms and undersampled it was the ClusterCentroidss algorithms. We used combinational approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithms. We compared the two learning model machines that reduce bias; BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict credit risk.

## Results:
